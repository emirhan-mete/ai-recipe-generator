# üß† AI-Powered Serverless Web App

This project is a serverless web application built using modern AWS services. It takes user input and generates intelligent responses using a large language model (LLM) via Amazon Bedrock. The app is designed with scalability, cost-efficiency, and security in mind ‚Äî making it a solid foundation for generative AI use cases.
